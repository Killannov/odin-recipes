    <h2>Ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb. squid</li>
      <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Clean the squid by pulling out the head and the insides. Slice into
        rings and pat them dry with a paper towel.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, black pepper, and garlic
        powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat up a large pot and add in enough vegetable oil to cover the squid.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the oil is heating up, toss the squid rings in the flour mixture
        until fully coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the oil is heated to around 375Â°F, carefully add in the
        flour-coated squid rings, and shallow-fry for about 2-3 minutes or until
        golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a slotted spoon, remove the fried calamari from the oil and place
        them onto a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot with lemon wedges and tartar sauce.</li>
    </ol>
